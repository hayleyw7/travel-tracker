# Travel Tracker

This is an application to manage and track different trips for users and a travel agency.

[It can be accessed here through GitHub Pages.](https://hayleyw7.github.io/travel-tracker/dist/index.html)

## Motivation and rubric

This project was completed as a project at Turing School of Software & Design during Module 2.

[The rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html)

The goals and objectives are to use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code, work with an API to send and receive data, solidify the code review process, & create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application.

## Reflections

A challenge was getting the new cards displaying on the DOM. This took a large amount of time.

Big successes were the Sass, fetches, and posts. These will be very useful to know moving forward.

## Languages and technology

Written in JavaScript, Mocha, Chai, HTML, & SCSS

Utilizes Webpack, NPM, & Node

Built with Visual Studio Code

A user logs into the site with the username `traveler` + their ID.

You will be presented a dashboard of current, past, pending, and future trips. You will also see your yearly payments so far.

If you click "Trip Planner", you will be able to schedule a trip.

Once you fill out and submit that form, you will see an estimated price, and then you can confirm it. Note that you will not be charged until it's approved by an agent.

Once you confirm it, you'll be send back to your dashboard, where it will be under "pending".

To end the session, click "Log Out".
